## How to Handle Nulls / Blanks in Power Query::

Step:1

Landing the power query >> observer which rows are null & which rows are blanks >> then you can select customer region >> if you have blank values >> you can click the right >> trim >> again you can select customer region >> Replace values >>In the first you don’t mention anything second box you have to mention “null” >> click ok >>Automatically replaced the with null in blank boxes.

Step:2

You can find out the null and blank values: Write the condition:
Land on the power query >> go to Add column >> Click the Custome column >> Write the condition : (=if ([Customer Region] = null) then 1 else 0) >> click ok >> Automatically generated Another column for value and nulls.

Step:3

Land on the power query >> go to Add column >> Click the Custome column >> Write the condition : (= if [Customer Region] = null then “Others” 
                            Else
                       If (Text.Contains([Customer Region],”o”)) then “Cat 1” else “Others”
Examples:
        
              (Text.Contains([Customer Region], "o")

              This checks if the column Customer Region contains the letter o (case-sensitive by default).

         Example:

             "North" → contains "o" → returns true

             "East" → does not contain "o" → returns false)

## Query Folding:

Query folding is ntg but generate a query that query statement to retrive and transform the source data.
Adv: When you have import mode Data Refresh very quickly.
     Direct query and Dual Stroage Based on the Query Foldinng.

Ex: When you have Used Sql Server that time you need to Extract the data from SQL Server to Power BI that time You can land on power Query Editor Window >> You need to see the Applied steps and Select the Left Side Table and inside Applied Steps Right Side Seeting Symbo in Navigation option You can right click on the Navigation option You Can See Enable "View Native Query" option Then It is Query Folding other Wise That is Not Query Folding.
